3. ✅ **Improved sentiment analysis** - Now considers ratings + keywords for accuracy

### Frontend (React):
1. ✅ **CombinedAnalysis.jsx** - New page for combined Google + Amazon reviews
2. ✅ **CombinedAnalysis.css** - Beautiful gradient styling
3. ✅ **Updated ReviewCard** - Shows source badges (Google Maps/Amazon) and verified purchase badges
4. ✅ **New App.jsx** - Router with navigation between pages
5. ✅ **GoogleMapsPage.jsx** - Original Google Maps functionality moved to separate page

## 🚀 How It Works:

### **Page 1: Google Maps Reviews** (/)
- Search for Dr. Martens store locations
- Scrapes 50+ reviews from Google Maps
- Shows location-specific feedback

### **Page 2: Combined Analysis** (/combined)
- Enter **both** Google Maps location AND Amazon product
- Example:
  - Google: "Dr. Martens Camden London"
  - Amazon: "Dr Martens 1460 boots"
- System fetches reviews from BOTH sources
- Reviews displayed in separate tabs:
  - **All Reviews** - Combined view
  - **Google Maps** - Only location reviews
  - **Amazon** - Only product reviews
- **Overall Summary** - Statistics from BOTH sources combined
- **AI Insights** - Generated from ALL reviews together
